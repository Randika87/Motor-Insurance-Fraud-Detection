# Motor-Insurance-Fraud-Detection
Insurance companies are one of the most important components of the financial sector for any country. One of the main challenges faced by insurance companies in current market environment are the fraud claims, especially in motor insurance domain. The number of fraud claims are expected to increase in the future, since claim counts are also increasing. Therefore, many researchers in the motor insurance field around the world are trying to find methods on detecting fraudulent claims as early by using machine learning algorithms. Motor claims fraud detection is a complex task since the fraud behavior different for each claim and the detected fraud cases are much low compared to the normal claims. This project aims to develop a motor insurance fraud detection model using classification algorithms and proposed a best model by using some evaluation criteriaâ€™s.  Dataset contains 30098 claims and out of these claims 3112 claims are labeled as fraudulent.  Dataset is imbalanced since fraud claims also known as positive cases only accounts 10% of total cases.  Past claim data are analyzed with underwriting details. Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and   XGBoost algorithms are used as the classifiers to detect a claim is fraudulent or not.
